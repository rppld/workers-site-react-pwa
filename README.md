# Workers Site React PWA

Example of React running in the client and a service worker, pre-rendered through a Cloudflare Worker.

This is based off of [Stefan Judisâ€™ original example](https://github.com/stefanjudis/react-in-a-worker) and makes it work with [Cloudflare Workers Sites](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites) for hosting static assets.
